# The Gaming Room

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room hired Creative Technology Solutions to develop a web-based version of their existing Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*. Their primary goal was to expand the game’s availability beyond the Android platform and make it accessible across multiple operating systems and devices. To accomplish this, they needed a scalable web-based application that could support multiple teams, multiple players per team, timed rounds, and progressive image rendering. The move to a browser-based platform allowed the game to reach a broader audience while maintaining its core gameplay mechanics.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I developed a thorough and organized design document that clearly captured the client’s needs and translated them into technical requirements. I focused on creating a structured document that aligned with the software architecture and provided a clear roadmap for development. The documentation helped ensure that each requirement was supported by a defined design decision.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The UML class diagram was especially helpful when transitioning from planning to development. It provided a clear visual representation of the relationships between classes, which made implementing inheritance, composition, and encapsulation much more straightforward. Having a defined structure reduced uncertainty during coding and helped maintain consistency across the application.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one section, I would expand and refine the requirements section. With more experience, I would provide deeper detail in both the functional and nonfunctional requirements, including clearer performance expectations and scalability considerations. Strengthening this section would make the overall design even more precise and better aligned with long-term system growth.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I carefully reviewed the client’s requirements multiple times throughout the project to ensure I fully understood their objectives. I translated those needs into specific design constraints and architectural decisions, such as enforcing unique game names and using a centralized game management service. Considering user needs is critical because software is ultimately built to solve a real problem. If the design does not reflect the client’s goals, even technically correct software can fail to deliver value.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design process incrementally. I began by identifying the functional and nonfunctional requirements, then clarified the rationale behind each one. After defining the design constraints and system scope, I created UML diagrams to visualize class relationships and overall system structure. This structured approach allowed me to move from analysis to implementation in a logical, step-by-step manner. In future projects, I would follow a similar approach while also incorporating additional validation steps, such as peer review of design diagrams and more detailed requirement analysis before development begins.
